Using GitHub for a free deployment of my personal website portfolio using GitHub Pages and workflows through GitHub Actions.

Summary : 

Initially I followed the step by step process for creating a GitHub Pages site [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site). The first deployment contained only HTML, CSS, JS and would briefly flash white when loading other html page content within the site. To fix this I had to make the swap over to the ReactJS framework to continuously load content within a single html page. Directions on how to deploy a website for free on GitHub can be found at [gitname/react-gh-pages](https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages).  

Build Instructions : 

- commit and push your code to the repository used for the page
- push the React app to the same repository using ``` $ npm run deploy ``` within a terminal
